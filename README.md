# Cassava Disease Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying cassava leaf diseases using image data.

## Problem Statement
Cassava crops are highly vulnerable to various leaf diseases that significantly affect yield. This project aims to develop an automated image-based classification system to assist in disease detection.

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Data augmentation techniques
- CNN architecture design using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
The trained model demonstrates the ability to classify cassava leaf diseases based on image features, showing the potential application of deep learning in agricultural monitoring systems.
